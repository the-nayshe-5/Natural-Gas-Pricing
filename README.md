# Natural Gas Price Prediction and Contract Pricing Model
## Task-1 : Natural Gas Price Analysis and Extrapolation
Analyze monthly natural gas prices to estimate prices at any date and extrapolate for an additional year.

#### Objectives

1. Analyze data to identify patterns and trends.
2. Develop a model to estimate prices at any date.
3. Extrapolate the model for an additional year.
4. Visualize data to identify seasonal trends.

#### Deliverables

1. Python script to estimate prices.
2. Data visualization.
3. Written report discussing findings.

## Task-2 : Prototype Pricing Model for Gas Storage Contracts
Develop a Python function to estimate the value of a gas storage contract based on input parameters.

#### Input Parameters
1. Injection dates
2. Withdrawal dates
3. Prices at which the commodity can be purchased/sold
4. Rate at which the gas can be injected/withdrawn
5. Maximum volume that can be stored
6. Storage costs

#### Objectives
1. Develop a prototype pricing model
2. Test with sample inputs
3. Provide a basis for further validation and testing

#### Deliverables
1. Python function implementing the pricing model
2. Sample input data and expected output values
